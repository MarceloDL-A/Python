PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS
Python Syntax: Medical Insurance Project
Suppose you are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs. Using a formula that estimates a person’s yearly insurance costs, you will investigate how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction.

Setting up Factors
1.
Our first step is to create the variables for each factor we will consider when estimating medical insurance costs.

These are the variables we will need to create:

age: age of the individual in years
sex: 0 for female, 1 for male*
BMI: individual’s body mass index
num_of_children: number of children the individual has
smoker: 0 for a non-smoker, 1 for a smoker
At the top of script.py, create the following variables for a 28-year-old, nonsmoking woman who has three children and a BMI of 26.2.

*We are using this medical insurance dataset as a guide, which unfortunately does not include data for non-binary individuals.


Hint
Your variables should look like this. For example, if our individual was a 35-year-old male who smokes, has 2 children, and a BMI of 27.3.

age = 35
smoker = 1
sex = 1
bmi = 27.3
num_of_children = 2 
Working with the Formula
2.
After the declaration of the variables, create a variable called insurance_costs that utilizes the following formula:

insurance\_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num\_of\_children + 24000*smoker - 12500insurance_cost=250*age-128*sex+370*bmi+425*num_of_children+24000*smoker-12500

Hint
The formula in the code editor should look like this:

insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
Note: Both sex and smoker are binary variables (either 0 or 1), so sometimes they may not be included as factors. However, it is important to have them written out in our general and always check for them.

3.
Let’s display this value in an informative way. Print out the following string in the terminal:

This person's insurance cost is {insurance_cost} dollars.
You will need to use string concatenation, including the str() function to print out the insurance_cost.


Hint
Your print statement should look like the following:

print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
The output of this print statement should be:

This person's insurance cost is 5469.0 dollars.
Looking at Age Factor
4.
We have seen how our formula can estimate costs for one individual. Now let’s play with some individual factors to see what role each one plays in our estimation!

Let’s start with the age factor. Using a plus-equal operator, add 4 years to our age variable.

5.
Now that we have changed our age value, we want to recalculate our insurance cost. Declare a new variable called new_insurance_costs underneath the expression that increased age by 4.

Make sure you leave the line with the insurance_cost variable the same. We will use it later in our program!

6.
Next, we want to find the difference between our new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost. To do this, let’s create a new variable called change_in_insurance_cost and set it equal to the difference between new_insurance_cost and insurance cost.

7.
We want to display this information in an informative way similar to the output from instruction 3. On the following line, print the following string in the terminal:

The change in cost of insurance after increasing the age by 4 years is {change_in_insurance_cost} dollars.
Doing this will tell us how 4 years in age affects medical insurance costs assuming that all other variables remain the same.

You will need to concatenate strings and use the str() method.


Hint
To concatenate our strings in a print statement, use the following piece of code:

print("The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing the age by 4 years is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars")
Looking at BMI Factor
8.
Now that you have looked at the age factor, let’s move onto another one: BMI. First, we have to redefine our age variable to be its original value.

Set age to 28 following your last piece of code. This will reset its value and allow us to focus on just the change in the BMI factor moving forward.

On the next line, using the plus-equal operator, add 3.1 to our bmi variable.

9.
Now let’s find out how a change in BMI affects insurance costs. Our next steps are pretty much the same as we have done before when looking at age.

Below the line where bmi was increased by 3.1, rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name new_insurance_cost.

Save the difference between new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost in a variable called change_in_insurance_cost

Display the following string in the output terminal:

The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing BMI by 3.1 is {change_in_insurance_cost} dollars.
You can leave the code above it as is, including the print statements.


Hint
Your code should look almost exactly the same as it did in the Looking at Age Factor.

When you run your code, you should see the following output:

The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing BMI by 3.1 is 1147.0 dollars.
Looking at Male vs. Female Factor
10.
Let’s look at the effect sex has on medical insurance costs. Before we make any additional changes, first reassign your bmi variable back to its original value of 26.2.

On a new line of code, reassign the value of sex to 1. A reminder that 1 identifies male individuals and 0 identifies female individuals.

11.
Perform the steps below!

Rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name new_insurance_cost.

Save the difference between new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost in a variable called change_in_insurance_cost.

Display the following string in the output terminal:

The change in estimated cost for being male instead if female is  {change_in_insurance_cost} dollars.

Hint
Step-by-step hints:

When you rewrite the formula, it should look like this:
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
Saving the difference in costs should look like this:
change_in_insurance_cost = new_cost - original_cost
To display the string in the terminal, do the following:
print("The change in estimated cost for being male instead if female is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
When you run this code, you should see the following output:

The estimated cost associated with being female instead of male is -128.0 dollars.
12.
Notice that this time you got a negative value for change_in_insurance_cost. Let’s think about what this means. We changed the sex variable from 0 (female) to 1 (male) and it decreased the estimated insurance costs.

This means that men tend to have lower medical costs on average than women. Reflect on the other findings you have dug up from this investigation so far.

Extra Practice

Great job on the project!!!

So far we have looked at 3 of the 5 factors in the insurance costs formula. The two remaining are smoker and num_of_children. If you want to keep challenging yourself, spend some time investigating these factors!

Rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name new_insurance_cost.

Save the difference between new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost in a variable called change_in_insurance_cost

Display the information in the terminal!
