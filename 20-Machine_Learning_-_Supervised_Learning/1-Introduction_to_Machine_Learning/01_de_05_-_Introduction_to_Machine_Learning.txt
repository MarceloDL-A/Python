WHY USE MACHINE LEARNING?
Introduction to Machine Learning
The year is 2049…

Neo York is overrun by bots and web crawlers. The capabilities of Machine Learning have reached new heights and the world as we know it will never be the same.

Facial recognition technology that helps users tag and share photos of friends can now tag future friends; night drones are on the prowl.

Machine learning powered self-driving cars (and flying cars) are now massively available to consumers. The steering wheel has become a thing of the past.

Recommendation engines that suggest what VR shows to watch and what products to buy will now display a different environment for each user group.

At the dawn of a new age, you can’t help but wonder, what is Machine Learning and how did it pivot our world so drastically?
