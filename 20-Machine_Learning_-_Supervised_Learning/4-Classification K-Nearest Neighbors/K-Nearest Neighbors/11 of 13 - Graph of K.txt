K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS
Graph of K
The graph to the right shows the validation accuracy of our movie classifier as k increases. When k is small, overfitting occurs and the accuracy is relatively low. On the other hand, when k gets too large, underfitting occurs and accuracy starts to drop.

Instructions
What seems to be the best k for this dataset?
Ans.: k = 77
