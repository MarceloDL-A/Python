K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR REGRESSOR
Regression
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm typically used for classification. However, it can also perform regression.

In this lesson, we will use the movie dataset that was used in the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier lesson. However, instead of classifying a new movie as either good or bad, we are now going to predict its IMDb rating as a real number.

This process is almost identical to classification, except for the final step. Once again, we are going to find the k nearest neighbors of the new movie by using the distance formula. However, instead of counting the number of good and bad neighbors, the regressor averages their IMDb ratings.

For example, if the three nearest neighbors to an unrated movie have ratings of 5.0, 9.2, and 6.8, then we could predict that this new movie will have a rating of 7.0.

Instructions
1.
We’ve imported most of the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. Before we dive into finishing the regressor, let’s refresh ourselves with the data.

At the bottom of your code, print movie_dataset["Life of Pi"]. You should see a list of three values. These values are the normalized values for the movie’s budget, runtime, and release year.


Hint
The result should be a list of three numbers - the first one being 0.00982356711895032.

2.
Print the rating for "Life of Pi". This can be found in movie_ratings.


Hint
The value you’re looking for is movie_ratings["Life of Pi"].

3.
We’ve included the majority of the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm in the predict() function. Right now, the variable neighbors stores a list of [distance, title] pairs.

Loop through every neighbor and find its rating in movie_ratings. Add those ratings together and return that sum divided by the total number of neighbors.


Hint
Your for loop might look like this:

total = 0

for neighbor in neighbors:
  title = neighbor[1]
  total += movie_ratings[title]

# Return the average here
4.
Call predict with the following parameters:

[0.016, 0.300, 1.022]
movie_dataset
movie_ratings
5
Print the result.

Note that the list [0.016, 0.300, 1.022] is the normalized budget, runtime, and year of the movie Incredibles 2! The normalized year is larger than 1 because our training set only had movies that were released between 1927 and 2016 — Incredibles 2 was released in 2018.


Hint
predict([0.016, 0.300, 1.022], movie_dataset, _____, _____)
Fill in the final two parameters!
