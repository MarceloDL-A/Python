"""
Since we are working with numpy objects, we can compare all the values in an array with some threshold using the following syntax:

np.where(array_to_check >= threshold, 1, 0)
If a value in array_to_check is above threshold, the output is 1. If a value in array_to_check is below threshold, the output is 0.
