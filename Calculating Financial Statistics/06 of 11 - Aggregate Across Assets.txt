CALCULATING FINANCIAL STATISTICS
Aggregate Across Assets
Although we will be focusing primarily on individual assets in this lesson, it is important to recognize that these investments often make up the pieces of a larger financial portfolio. Portfolios will be covered more in depth in a future lesson, but let’s get a preview of how to calculate the expected rate of return for an entire portfolio of investments.

As we’ve learned earlier, using the simple rate of return makes it easy to aggregate across multiple assets. The portfolio return would simply be the weighted average of each individual asset’s simple rate of return.

R = (W_{1} * R_{1}) + (W_{2} * R_{2}) + ... + (W_{n} * R_{n})R=(W

?	 *R

n

R: portfolio simple rate of return
Wi: weight of the ith investment in the portfolio
Ri: simple rate of return of the ith investment in the portfolio
The weights of each asset is obtained by:

W_{i} = \frac{S_{i}}{S_{1} + S_{2} + ... + S_{n}}W
