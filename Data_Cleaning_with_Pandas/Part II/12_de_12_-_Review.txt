DATA CLEANING WITH PANDAS
Review
Great! We have looked at a number of different methods we may use to get data into the format we want for analysis.

Specifically, we have covered:

diagnosing the “tidiness” of the data
reshaping the data
combining multiple files
changing the types of values
dropping or filling missing values - how we deal with data that is incomplete or missing
manipulating strings to represent the data better
You can use these methods to transform your datasets to be clean and easy to work with!
