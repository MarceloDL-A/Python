MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
Visualizing Results with Matplotlib
You’ve performed Multiple Linear Regression, and you also have the predictions in y_predict. However, we don’t have insight into the data, yet. In this exercise, you’ll create a 2D scatterplot to see how the independent variables impact prices.

How do you create 2D graphs?

Graphs can be created using Matplotlib’s pyplot module. Here is the code with inline comments explaining how to plot using Matplotlib’s .scatter():

# Create a scatter plot
plt.scatter(x, y, alpha=0.4)

# Create x-axis label and y-axis label
plt.xlabel("the x-axis label")
plt.ylabel("the y-axis label")

# Create a title
plt.title("title!")

# Show the plot
plt.show()
We want to create a scatterplot like this:

Visualization
Instructions
1.
Create a 2D scatter plot using y_test and y_predict.

The x-axis should represent actual rent prices and the y-axis should represent predicted rent prices.


Hint
It should look something like:

plt.scatter(y_test, y_predict, alpha=0.4)
The alpha parameter is added to better understand overlapping of points (0.0 transparent - 1.0 opaque).

2.
Add appropriate x-axis labels and y-axis labels, as well as a title.


Hint
plt.xlabel("Prices: $Y_i$")
plt.ylabel("Predicted prices: $\hat{Y}_i$")
plt.title("Actual Rent vs Predicted Rent")
3.
Show the plot using plt.show().


Hint
This line displays the figure:

plt.show()
