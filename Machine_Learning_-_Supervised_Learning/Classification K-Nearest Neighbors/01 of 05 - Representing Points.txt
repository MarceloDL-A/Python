DISTANCE FORMULA
Representing Points
In this lesson, you will learn three different ways to define the distance between two points:

Euclidean Distance
Manhattan Distance
Hamming Distance
Before diving into the distance formulas, it is first important to consider how to represent points in your code.

In this exercise, we will use a list, where each item in the list represents a dimension of the point. For example, the point (5, 8) could be represented in Python like this:

pt1 = [5, 8]
Points aren’t limited to just two dimensions. For example, a five-dimensional point could be represented as [4, 8, 15, 16, 23].

Ultimately, we want to find the distance between two points. We’ll be writing functions that look like this:

distance([1, 2, 3], [5, 8, 9])
Note that we can only find the difference between two points if they have the same number of dimensions!

Instructions
1.
We’ve created a few points in script.py.

Create a new point named four_d that has four dimensions.

Hint
A list is a common Python datatype that is ordered and changeable. It allows duplicate values.

Creating a list is as simple as putting different comma-separated values between square brackets:

animals = ["pangolin", "cassowary", "sloth"]
four_d should be a list of four numbers:

# Suppose we have a point (4, 6, -1, 2)
four_d = [4, 6, -1, 2]
