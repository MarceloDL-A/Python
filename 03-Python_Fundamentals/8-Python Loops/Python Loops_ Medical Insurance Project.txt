PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS
Python Loops: Medical Insurance Project
You are interested in analyzing medical insurance cost data efficiently without writing repetitive code.

In this project, you will use your new knowledge of Python loops to iterate through and analyze medical insurance cost data.

Let’s get started!

Creating a For Loop
1.
First, let’s take a look at the three lists in script.py:

names stores the names of seven individuals.
estimated_insurance_costs stores the estimated medical insurance costs for the individuals.
actual_insurance_costs stores the actual insurance costs paid by the individuals.
We want to calculate the average insurance cost each person paid. We’ll start by adding up all of the insurance costs.

Create a variable total_cost and initialize it to 0.


Hint
Use the following code to define the total_cost variable:

total_cost = 0
2.
Use a for loop to iterate through actual_insurance_costs and add each insurance cost to the variable total_cost.


Hint
Use the following code to write this for loop:

for insurance_cost in actual_insurance_costs:
  total_cost += insurance_cost
Note that insurance_cost is a temporary variable used to store the element in actual_insurance_costs at each iteration of the loop. This variable can be named whatever we want.

3.
After the for loop, create a variable called average_cost that stores the total_cost divided by the length of the actual_insurance_costs list.


Hint
To get the length of actual_insurance_costs use the len() function:

average_cost = total_cost/len(actual_insurance_costs)
4.
Print average_cost with the following message:

Average Insurance Cost: <average_cost> dollars.

Hint
You need to use the str() function to change average_cost to a string and then concatenate the strings:

print("Average insurance cost: " + str(average_cost) + " dollars.")
Using Range in Loops
5.
For each individual in names, we want to determine whether their insurance cost is above or below average.

Write a for loop with variable i that goes from 0 to len(names).

Note: If you run this loop it will return an error because there is currently no code inside of the loop. We’ll fix this in the next step.


Hint
Use the range() function to write this for loop:

for i in range(len(names)):
  # code
6.
Inside of the for loop, do the following:

Create a variable name, which stores names[i].
Create a variable insurance_cost, which stores actual_insurance_costs[i].
Print out the insurance cost for each individual, with the following message:
The insurance cost for <name> is <insurance_cost> dollars.

Hint
The for loop should look like:

for i in range(len(names)):
  name = names[i]
  insurance_cost = actual_insurance_costs[i]
  print("The insurance cost for " + name + " is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
7.
Click “Save” to see the result.

You should see the insurance costs for each of the seven individuals in names. The for loop iterated through the entire list and printed out the insurance cost for each individual.


Hint
The output should look like:

The insurance cost for Judith is 1100.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Abel is 2200.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Tyson is 3300.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Martha is 4400.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Beverley is 5500.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for David is 6600.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Anabel is 7700.0 dollars.
Conditions inside a Loop
8.
Inside of the for loop, use if, elif, else statements after the print statement to check whether the insurance cost is above, below, or equal to the average. Print out messages for each case:

When insurance_cost is higher than the average, print out the following:
The insurance cost for <name> is above average.
When insurance_cost is lower than the average, print out the following:
The insurance cost for <name> is below average.
Otherwise, print out the following:
The insurance cost for <name> is equal to the average.

Hint
The for loop should now look like:

for i in range(len(names)):
  name = names[i]
  insurance_cost = actual_insurance_costs[i]
  print("The insurance cost for " + name + " is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

  # checks if insurance cost is above average
  if insurance_cost > average_cost:
    print("The insurance cost for " + name + " is above average.")

  # checks if insurance cost is below average
  elif insurance_cost < average_cost:
    print("The insurance cost for " + name + " is below average.")

  # checks if insurance cost is equal to the average
  else:
    print("The insurance cost for " + name + " is equal to the average.")
9.
Click “Save” to see the results.

You should see messages indicating the insurance cost for each of the seven individuals and where their insurance cost stands relative to the average.


Hint
You should see the following output:

The insurance cost for Judith is 1100.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Judith is below average.
The insurance cost for Abel is 2200.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Abel is below average.
The insurance cost for Tyson is 3300.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Tyson is below average.
The insurance cost for Martha is 4400.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Martha is equal to the average.
The insurance cost for Beverley is 5500.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Beverley is above average.
The insurance cost for David is 6600.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for David is above average.
The insurance cost for Anabel is 7700.0 dollars.
The insurance cost for Anabel is above average.
Creating a List Comprehension
10.
If you look closely at actual_insurance_costs and estimated_insurance_costs, you will notice that each of the actual insurance costs are 10% higher than the estimated insurance costs.

Using a list comprehension, create a new list called updated_estimated_costs, which has each element in estimated_insurance_costs multiplied by 11/10.


Hint
The syntax for a list comprehension is as follows:

updated_list = [expression for item in list]
In this example, updated_estimated_costs should look like:

updated_estimated_costs = [estimated_cost * 11/10 for estimated_cost in estimated_insurance_costs]
11.
Print updated_estimated_costs.

You should see that the list now looks the same as actual_insurance_costs.


Hint
Use the following code to print updated_estimated_costs:

print(updated_estimated_costs)
The output should look like:

[1100.0, 2200.0, 3300.0, 4400.0, 5500.0, 6600.0, 7700.0]
Extra
12.
Congratulations! In this project, you used Python loops to iterate through and analyze medical insurance cost data.

As a data scientist, you want to be able to easily and efficiently go through data and perform analysis on that data without having to write repetitive code. Loops are a great place to start.

If you’d like extra practice with Python loops, here are some suggestions to get you started:

Convert the first for loop in the code to a while loop.
Modify the second for loop so that it also calculates how far above or below the average the estimated insurance cost is.
Happy coding!
